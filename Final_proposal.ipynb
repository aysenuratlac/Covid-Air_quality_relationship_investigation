    "**Introduction**\n",
    "\n",
    "The late 2019 COVID-19 epidemic drastically changed the world and had an impact on many aspects of human life. This new coronavirus, called SARS-CoV-2, quickly traveled across continents, resulting in extensive disease, mortality, and significant disruptions to communities all over the world. The condition of the air quality also received significant attention during this health crisis. There was a discernible effect on air pollution levels when countries imposed lockdowns and restrictions to stop the virus from spreading. This presented a rare chance to investigate the complex interaction between the pandemic and environmental factors, specifically air quality.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Objectives**\n",
    "\n",
    "This proposal outlines a thorough research project meant to look at the relationship between COVID-19 and air quality based on time and location. The goal of the research is to examine the complex interactions that exist between the COVID-19 virus transmission and prevalence and several facets of air quality. This proposal includes a comprehensive methodology that describes the procedures for gathering data, and doing statistical analyses.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Dataset**\n",
    "\n",
    "For this project investigating the correlation between COVID-19 and air quality, three pivotal datasets have been identified to conduct a comprehensive analysis. The primary datasets include:\n",

    "These three critical datasets, when integrated and analyzed systematically, will facilitate a robust investigation into the potential correlations and patterns between COVID-19 cases and air quality parameters.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Questions**\n",
    "\n",
    "During the recent COVID-19 pandemic, variations in the number of cases across diverse timeframes and locations have raised inquiries regarding a possible correlation with air quality. The air we breathe is subject to numerous factors, ranging from industrial emissions to geographical influences, which directly impact its composition. As such, understanding whether fluctuations in COVID-19 cases relate to fluctuations in air quality parameters becomes a crucial exploration. Unveiling potential links between these variables could offer invaluable insights into disease spread dynamics and susceptibility, contributing significantly to our comprehension of the interplay between environmental elements and public health.\n",
    "\n",
    "With this research, we intend to address the following questions:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Is there a possible or actual association between the air quality metrics and the data of COVID-19 cases?\n",
    "- Does the frequency of COVID-19 cases in a country have a significant correlation with the air quality measures that indicate the quality of the air at places at the national level?\n",
    "\n",
    "**Methods**\n",
    "\n",
    "The approach can be described step-by-step as follows:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Data Preprocessing:**\n",
    "\n",
    "There are three different data sources that we will use.Thus, the first thing we should do is datapreprocessing.Covid19 and air quality datasets have different time ranges.We will determine the appropriate date range where they intersect and perform a merging operation accordingly.Also, we will do this research for Europian countries. So we should extract corresponding countries from all datasets. Additionaly, other preprocessing steps can be interpreted(i.e. date formats, handling missing values, merging related datasets..)\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Correlation Analysis:**\n",
    "\n",
    "We will do detailed research about correlation analysis methods, and decide which methods to use. Here are some methods below:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Pearson Correlation Coefficient:\n",
    "\n",
    "Measures the linear correlation between two continuous variables. It assesses the strength and direction of the linear relationship between variables. This method is suitable for normally distributed data.\n",
    "\n",
    "The correlation coefficient ranges from -1 to 1, with 1 indicating a perfect positive correlation, -1 indicating a perfect negative correlation, and 0 indicating no correlation.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Spearman's Rank Correlation:\n",
    "\n",
    "Assesses the strength and direction of monotonic relationships between variables. It does not assume linearity and is suitable for ordinal or non-normally distributed data.\n",
    "\n",
    "It calculates the correlation based on the ranks of the data rather than the actual values, making it more robust to outliers.Particularly useful when the relationship between variables might not be linear.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Kendall's Tau:\n",
    "\n",
    "Another method to measure the ordinal association between two measured quantities. Like Spearman's, Kendall's Tau is used when variables may have a non-linear relationship.\n",
    "\n",
    "It computes the correlation based on the number of concordant and discordant pairs of data points.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Distance Correlation:\n",
    "\n",
    "Measures the dependence between two random variables or datasets without assuming a linear relationship. It captures both linear and non-linear associations between variables.\n",
    "\n",
    "Useful when traditional methods like Pearson's correlation may miss non-linear relationships.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Cross-Correlation Analysis:\n",
    "\n",
    "Specifically used in time-series analysis to identify lagged correlations between two time-dependent variables. It helps in understanding if changes in one variable precede or follow changes in the other.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Partial Correlation:\n",
    "\n",
    "Measures the relationship between two variables while controlling for the influence of other variables. It helps determine the direct relationship between two variables after accounting for the effects of other variables.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Data Visualization:**\n",
    "\n",
    "In data analysis, visualization is essential due to how it converts detailed information into understandable insights. It makes data interpretation easier by using graphs, charts, and other illustrations to quickly identify patterns. In particular, scatter plots and time series stand out as essential data visualization techniques because they provide distinct insights into patterns and relationships in the data.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this project, we will explore data based on time and location seperately. For analysing based on time, we can visualize data as time series graph. Besides, for the analysis based on locations, the daily COVID-19 cases against different air quality metrics for each country can be plotted by scatter plot. This can provide a visual understanding of any potential relationships between the variables.Also, we will use country polygons data in order to visualize data on map, also understand quantities with heatmap.\n",
    "\n",
    "It is crucial to not forget that apart from gases, we should consider other relevant factors such as population density, healthcare infrastructure, government policies, and socioeconomic factors. If any inconsistencies are detected as a result of data processing, such factors may also be taken into account.\n",
